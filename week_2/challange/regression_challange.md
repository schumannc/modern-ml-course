## Singapore House Pricing Challenge

### Objective

Your task is to create a notebook using the content and knowledge acquired in the regression problem lectures. The notebook should:
1. Experiment with a different target variable (price_per_sqm).
2. Perform feature selection using Boruta.
3. Conduct hyperparameter tuning with a multi-objective Optuna (optimize for coverage and interval width).
4. Build a final conformalized CatBoost quantile regressor.
5. Save the experiment results in MLflow.
